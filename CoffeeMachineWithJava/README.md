# Coffee Machine

## Overview

The Coffee Machine is a console-based Java application that simulates a coffee vending machine. Users can interact with the machine to buy coffee, refill ingredients, check the current state of the machine, and take the money earned from sales. The project demonstrates object-oriented programming concepts in Java and provides a user-friendly interface for coffee lovers.

## How It Works

- **User Actions**: The application allows users to perform several actions:
  - **Buy Coffee**: Users can choose between three types of coffee: espresso, latte, and cappuccino. The machine checks if there are enough ingredients to fulfill the order before preparing the coffee.
  - **Fill Ingredients**: Users can refill the coffee machine with water, milk, coffee beans, and disposable cups.
  - **Take Money**: Users can collect the money earned from selling coffee.
  - **Check Remaining Ingredients**: Users can view the current state of the machine, including the amount of water, milk, coffee beans, disposable cups, and the total money earned.


## Future Development

This project is open for future development and improvements. Potential enhancements include:
- Adding more coffee options and customizations for users.
- Implementing a graphical user interface (GUI) for a more interactive experience.
- Introducing user authentication and order history tracking.

## Technologies Used

- **Java**: For implementing the application logic.
- **Console I/O**: For user interaction through the command line.
