# Car Rental Management System

## Overview

The Car Rental Management System is a web application built with Spring Boot that allows users to manage car rentals efficiently. This project includes a well-structured database with three main tables: `CAR`, `CUSTOMER`, and `COMPANY`. Each table plays a crucial role in managing car rental information.

- **CAR Table**: Stores details about the cars available for rent, including their specifications and availability status.
- **CUSTOMER Table**: Holds information about customers, including their personal details and rented car ID. When a customer rents a car, the `RENTED_CAR_ID` field is updated accordingly.
- **COMPANY Table**: Contains information about the rental companies, allowing users to manage multiple companies and their respective fleets.

## Future Development

This project is open for future development and improvements. Whether it's adding new features, enhancing existing functionality, or optimizing performance, contributions are welcome! The project aims to evolve based on user feedback and needs.
